"""adapter: how any agent, rule engine or model plugs into a UAI-1 decider without becoming part of the protocol.

THE BOUNDARY, IN ONE SENTENCE

An adapter RECOMMENDS; a receiver's policy DECIDES; only the decider's own signer SIGNS; and a person APPROVES what
needs one. An adapter is handed plain data (the disclosed fields and the subject) and returns text or a mapping. It is
never handed a `Signer`, a ledger, a trust policy or a grant, so nothing it returns can acquire authority: the most it
can do is be believed, and `AdapterJudge` believes it only as far as the policy lets it.

WHAT AN ADAPTER DECLARES (`AgentAdapter`)

  info()          who is behind it: provider, model, agent name and, truthfully, `live` (did a real provider answer?)
  capabilities()  what it offers, as ordinary UAI-1 capabilities (an advertisement, not a grant: manifest.py)
  recommend(...)  the raw output for one disclosed document; whatever it returns is untrusted input

HOW ITS OUTPUT IS READ (`parse_recommendation`)

Strictly, with the same JSON reader the wire uses (duplicate keys, floats and NaN refused, 1 MiB at most) and exactly
these keys: verdict, reasons, evidence, escalate. A reply that is prose around JSON, has an extra key (a model
announcing "sign: true", say), names a verdict that does not exist, or claims evidence the capability does not produce is
refused as `adapter_output`, and the decider answers with a signed terminal_breach saying the capability failed. It does
not guess what the model meant.

WHAT THE POLICY ADDS (`AdapterJudge`)

A `policy(capability, disclosed, subject, recommendation)` the DECIDER writes, in code, with the facts in front of it. It
can lower a verdict, add reasons, or demand escalation; it is the one place a pass is allowed to stay a pass. A
recommendation of `escalate: true` becomes a retry whose reason says a person must look, which is how a refusal or an
escalation travels over UAI-1 without a new message kind.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE

The test doubles in this repository are deterministic scripts. Nothing here calls a model provider, so nothing here is
evidence that any provider's model interoperates. `PromptedModelAdapter` is the seam where a real provider's completion
function plugs in; that plug-in is a contract, labeled `live=False` until someone runs it.
