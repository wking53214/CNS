"""decision: a verdict another system can check on its own, and a guard that acts on it once.

WHY THIS EXISTS

`SuperGate.decide` proves its decisions with an HMAC under a key that never leaves the process, and `DecisionGuard`
spends a decision's nonce in a set that lives in the same process. Both are right for one process and say nothing to
any other. This module is the distributed counterpart:

  `issue` signs a decision as a UAI-1 envelope, bound to the exact terms, the exact document, the exact accept it
    answers and the one identity it is addressed to, and expiring when the terms say.
  `from_super_gate` exports a CNS `Decision` that THIS process's SuperGate issued (`decision.issued`). A hand-built
    or edited Decision is refused at export, so the in-process proof is not laundered into a signature.
  `verify_decision` is everything the receiving system checks, with no access to the decider: the signature, that
    the signer is the decider the terms name, the audience, the reply binding, the terms digest, the document, the
    evidence, that the decision lives no longer than agreed, and (through its ledger) that it is new.
  `RemoteDecisionGuard` is `DecisionGuard` for a decision that came from elsewhere: closed until a verified, allowed
    decision opens it, then permits one action on the one document. Its ledger may be a `FileLedger`, so the
    process that performs the action need not be the one that received the decision.

The verdict vocabulary is CNS's own `GateOutcome`: "pass", "retry", "terminal_breach".
