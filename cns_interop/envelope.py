"""envelope: the one shape every UAI-1 message takes, signed so the receiver can check it alone.

WHY THIS EXISTS

CNS's contracts let two systems agree on what a decision MEANS. They did not say how one system hands another a
request, an offer or a decision, or how the receiver tells a genuine message from a forged, edited, replayed or
expired one. Without that, "interoperable" meant "imports the same Python package in the same process".

An envelope is a small, fixed set of fields around a free-form `body`:

    v            "uai/1", the protocol version. Anything else is refused, never guessed at.
    kind         what the message is (KINDS).
    id           32 random hex digits, unique per message; a receiver's ledger refuses a second use.
    from         the sender's identity (identity.py). The signature must verify as this key.
    to           the one identity it is addressed to, or "" for a broadcast such as a manifest.
    conversation the id of the message that opened the exchange.
    in_reply_to  the digest of the envelope this answers, or "". A reply is bound to exact content, not to an id.
    issued_at    milliseconds since the epoch, an integer.
    expires_at   milliseconds, an integer after issued_at, or null for a message that does not expire.
    body         a mapping, in the profile below.
    sig          Ed25519 over the domain tag "uai/1 sig\\n" and the CNS subject digest of every other field.

The digest is `cns.gate.subject_digest`, the length-prefixed canonical encoding CNS already publishes with
cross-language vectors (contracts/digest-vectors.json). JSON is only the transport; two senders that write the same
envelope with different spacing or key order produce the same signature input.

THE PROFILE

Values are text, booleans, null, integers within +/-(2**53 - 1), lists, and mappings with text keys. Floats are
refused: every runtime renders a float its own way, and a signature that one implementation cannot reproduce is a
signature that implementation cannot check. Send a decimal as text or as an integer in the smallest unit. Nesting is
limited to 32 levels and the wire form to 1 MiB.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO

It authenticates; it does not encrypt. An envelope on an open channel can be read by anyone on it. Confidentiality is
the transport's job (TLS, an SSH pipe, a sealed queue); see docs/interop/UAI-1.md for what that leaves open.
