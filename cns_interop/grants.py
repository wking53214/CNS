"""grants: what THIS receiver permits, for which purpose, to whom, until when, and with whose approval.

WHY THIS EXISTS

A signature is not permission, and a manifest is an advertisement. A verified decision says a decider judged a document;
it does not say this receiver will act on it. Without a receiver-side step, any code that holds a `Verified` decision
decides for itself what that permits. A `GrantTable` is that step. It is the receiver's own policy, default deny, and
nothing a sender signs can add to it.

THE QUESTIONS IT ANSWERS (each a stable refusal code)

  Is there a grant at all for this capability and version?     no_grant
  Is it still in force, and not withdrawn?                      grant_expired, withdrawn
  Is the decider one this grant names?                          decider
  Is the action one this grant names?                           action
  Will this receiver disclose what the terms ask to see?        disclosure   (a ceiling on `terms["disclose"]`)
  Does this action need a human, and did one say yes?           approval_required, approval
  Could the evidence be retained?                               unavailable  (the audit write failed, so nothing is permitted)

PURPOSE needs no new field on the wire. UAI-1 terms are signed over the capability NAME and VERSION, so a purpose is
a capability name that carries it (`income-screen.loan-underwriting`). A decision negotiated under one purpose names
that capability and a grant for another purpose does not match it. The receiver chooses its purposes by choosing the
names it grants.

HUMAN APPROVAL is local to the receiver. An `Approval` is signed by an approver identity the grant lists, bound to
one decision, one action and one document, and expires. The approver can never be the decider, the requester, or any
identity the receiver treats as an agent, so an agent or a model cannot approve its own recommendation. This module
never gives any signing key to an adapter (adapter.py); approval keys belong to people.

EVIDENCE: every permit and every refusal is appended to a hash-chained audit record. Each entry carries the digest of
the one before, so removing or editing an entry is detectable (`verify_audit`); it does not stop someone with write
access from truncating the tail, which is what an external anchor of the last digest is for.

NOT HERE: delegation (a grant is for the requester it names, and cannot be passed on), and a shared grant store across
hosts (the table is one receiver's own memory, loaded from its own configuration).
