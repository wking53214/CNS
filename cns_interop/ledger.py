"""ledger: a receiver's memory of which messages it has already acted on, so none is acted on twice.

A signature proves a message is genuine; it cannot prove the message is new. Anyone who saw a signed decision can
send it again. The receiver therefore keeps a ledger of (sender, message id) pairs it has accepted, and `spend`
refuses a pair it has seen. Because every message the session layer accepts must expire, an entry only has to be
kept until its message would be refused as expired anyway.

WHAT EACH LEDGER GUARANTEES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT

  MemoryLedger      one process. Lost on restart.
  FileLedger        many processes on ONE host, sharing one file under a POSIX lock. Not for network filesystems.
  SqliteLedger      many processes on ONE host, sharing one SQLite database (transactions, not hand-written locking).
  CoordinatedLedger many hosts, but ONLY if the `Coordinator` it is given is a linearizable store the receiver owns
                    (etcd, a SQL primary with a unique key, Redis with compare-and-set). A coordinator that cannot
                    answer makes the ledger refuse ("unavailable"). It never guesses. No coordinator ships here; the
                    in-memory one is a test stand-in, so cross-host behaviour is demonstrated against that stand-in.

Two hosts with two FileLedgers accept the same decision twice. That is not a defect in FileLedger, it is what a local
ledger is. A deployment with several hosts acting for one identity must use a coordinated ledger or send every
redemption to one host.

TWO PHASES

`spend` consumes a message at once. An action that can fail after the permission is checked wants the permission to
survive the failure: `reserve` takes a lease on the message (a second reserve is refused while the lease is live),
`commit` consumes it for good, `release` gives it back when the action did not happen. A holder that crashes loses
its lease when it lapses and the message can be reserved again. That makes the action at-least-once, so the action
must be idempotent on `Reservation.key`, the idempotency key it is handed.

`reserve`, `commit` and `release` are separate from `Ledger` on purpose: a ledger that only offers `spend` still works
everywhere it did.
