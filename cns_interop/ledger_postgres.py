"""ledger_postgres: a ledger whose truth lives in PostgreSQL, so several hosts share it.

WHAT IT GUARANTEES, AND WHAT IT NEEDS TO

  * One row per message `(sender, id)`. `reserve` and `spend` are a single `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE ... WHERE`
    statement: the row lock makes it atomic, so of any number of concurrent callers on any number of hosts exactly one is
    granted. A lapsed lease is taken over by the same statement; a live lease or a committed message is `replayed`.
  * Time is the DATABASE's. Every lease is judged by the server's clock; the caller's clock is ignored unless a test
    stand-in is allowed to drive time (`allow_caller_time`). A host with a wrong clock cannot shorten anyone's lease.
  * A message that has expired by the server's clock is refused (`expired`) by `spend` and `reserve`, never granted. The
    ledger forgets a row `keep_ms` after its message expired, by the same clock, so a forgotten row is one no spend can
    take again whatever a receiver's own clock says (RACE-02 R2-C-01: a receiver whose clock lagged by more than `keep_ms`
    once redeemed an expired decision again after the purge). `TrustedClock` is the receiver-side half of the same rule.
  * Each grant draws a fence from a sequence, so it only ever grows (see fencing.FencedTarget).
  * Failure is refusal. A connection that cannot be made, a statement that times out (`statement_timeout`,
    `lock_timeout`, `tcp_user_timeout`), a dropped link, a server that is down or in recovery: `Refused("unavailable")`.
    An ambiguous commit (the server may have committed and the answer was lost) is also `unavailable`; the row may then be
    held until its lease lapses, which is the documented model (docs/interop/CONSISTENCY.md).

AND WHAT IT DOES NOT GUARANTEE BY ITSELF. A single PostgreSQL node is exactly as available and durable as that node.
Several hosts sharing it are safe from double redemption while it is up. HIGH AVAILABILITY needs a standby, and an
asynchronous standby can lose an acknowledged reservation on failover (measured with Redis in CONSISTENCY.md; PostgreSQL
behaves the same way). Pass `require_sync_replication=True` to make every write demand quorum-durable commit
(`synchronous_standby_names` set, `synchronous_commit` of `on` or stronger): the ledger then refuses to write unless the
server is configured that way, and a commit that the standby cannot confirm times out as `unavailable` instead of being
acknowledged. That is a configuration check plus a timeout; it is not a proof of the server's replication.

EXACTLY-ONCE EFFECTS. `commit_in(connection, reservation)` runs the commit on the CALLER's open transaction, so a business
write and the spend of the message happen together or not at all. That is the one place this ledger can support an
exactly-once effect; a target that is not in the same database gets at-least-once and the idempotency key.
