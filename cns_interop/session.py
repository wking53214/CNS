"""session: the two roles of a UAI-1 exchange, each run by its own system under its own policy.

`Decider` holds capabilities and decides. `Requester` asks. Neither reaches into the other: everything passes as a
signed envelope, and each side checks what it receives against its own trust policy, its own ledger and its own
record of what it sent. Either can run in any process, on any host, in any language that implements UAI-1
(docs/interop/UAI-1.md); the reference agent in `interop/node/` is one that shares no code with this file.

What each side checks, in order, on every message it receives:

  1. the envelope (envelope.open_envelope): form, version, signature, time, audience
  2. that the message expires (session messages must, so a ledger never grows without bound)
  3. trust (trust.TrustPolicy.admit): the decider admits requesters; the requester only talks to deciders it admitted
     when it read their manifest
  4. that it answers something this side actually sent, and came from the party it was sent to
  5. the ledger: not seen before
  6. the step's own rules: terms (negotiate.py), disclosure (disclosure.py), decision (decision.py)

A failure at 1, 2 or 5 raises `Refused`: an unauthenticated or replayed message gets no reply. A failure after the
sender is authenticated and admitted is answered with a signed `refuse`, so the other side learns why.
